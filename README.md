# hydroutils

`hydroutils` is a collection of classes (written in Python 3.7) that can be used for rapid development and implementation of hydrological models.  These classes were originally created by Dr Sopan Patil during the development of EXP-HYDRO hydrological model (https://sopanpatil.github.io/exp-hydro/).  Nonetheless, they are generic enough to be useful for building other models.
